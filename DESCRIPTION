Description: Mixtures of skewed and elliptical distributions are implemented using mixtures of multivariate skew 
    power exponential and power exponential distributions, respectively. A generalized expectation-maximization 
    framework is used for parameter estimation. Methodology for mixtures of power exponential distributions is 
    from Dang et al. (2015) <doi: 10.1111/biom.12351>.
