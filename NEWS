mixSPE v0.9.1 (Release date: 2021-19-01)
==============
Complete rewrite of code with one function being the workhorse now: EMGr, in which skewness is an argument so it can be toggled on and off easily. Previous functions mpe and mspe are no longer available. The new code is much more efficient.

==============
First release.
